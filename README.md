# Hangman-Game
A one-page hangman game app I built wtih JavaScript and Boostrap.  

## Play Animal-Themed Hangman! 

* Every word the game proposes is an animal. 
* Make letter guesses by pressing any letter on the keyboard. 
* Every letter you guess right will appear on the screen as part of the word.  
* Every letter you guess wrong will appear in a wrong guesses section.  
* You have up to 9 wrong guesses before the end of the game. 
* When you guess the word correctly, an alert will tell you you've won and a new game will start.  
* If you use up all 9 guesses and you haven't guessed the word correctly, an alert will tell you "Game Over" and a new game will start.   
* The number of times you win and lose are tallied at the bottom of the screen.
